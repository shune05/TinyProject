# TinyProject
Overview
This project implements custom C++ classes for solving systems of linear equations and applies them to predict CPU performance using linear regression. It includes support for both square and non-square systems, as well as methods suitable for symmetric positive-definite matrices.

Structure
Part A: Linear Solvers
Vector.cpp: Implements a 1D vector with operator overloading and indexing.
Matrix.cpp: Implements a 2D matrix with support for basic operations, determinant, inverse, and pseudo-inverse.
LinearSystem.cpp: Solves square systems using Gaussian elimination with pivoting.
PosSymLinSystem.cpp: Solves symmetric positive-definite systems using the Conjugate Gradient method.
Part B: Regression and Real-world Application
main.cpp: Applies Moore-Penrose Pseudo-inverse and Tikhonov Regularization for linear regression.
Loads and processes CPU performance dataset.
Trains regression models using your solvers.
Evaluates performance using RMSE.
Results
RMSE (Pseudo-inverse): ~59.86
RMSE (Tikhonov): ~59.86
Conjugate Gradient showed fast convergence on SPD systems
